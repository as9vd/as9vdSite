            <p class="paragraph">Hello lads, welcome to my site. My name is Asad, and I am a 4th-year at the University
                of
                Virginia (as of 9/23/23). I am a Computer Engineering major, but I really enjoy building software.
                I've got 2 SWE internships under my belt (Parsons Corporation & Zillow), and I build stuff in my
                free-time.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                I'm on a different mission.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                I'm interested in algorithms, soccer, finance (somewhat), sociology, hardware, and low-level
                programming.
                I also love working towards the mastery of my skills, and I am never content with stagnation.
                I love learning. I'm inspired by a few, but my mind really drives itself (like Tesla); I always had a
                little something extra.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                Below are some of the projects I've worked on. All of these are things I've done in my free-time,
                barring the modified Shannon Switching Game. I included that anyway, because I still think it's pretty
                neat, and it gives an insight into how I approach complex, open-ended problems.
