            <p class="paragraph">Hello lads, welcome to my site. My name is Asad, and I am a 4th-year at the University
                of
                Virginia (as of 9/23/23). I am a Computer Engineering major, and I really enjoy building software.
                I've got 2 SWE internships under my belt. I did full-stack development for Parsons Corporation in 2022,
                and Android development for Zillow in 2023.
            </p>

            <p class="paragraph">
                I'm highly effective when it
                comes to
                writing code in
                <b>Java</b>,
                <b>Python</b>,
                <b>Kotlin</b>,
                <b>JavaScript</b>, and
                <b>TypeScript</b>.
                I'm also proficient in
                <b>C</b>,
                <b>C++</b>, and
                <b>VHDL</b>. Finally, I've also done a good amount with
                <b>HTML</b> and
                <b>CSS</b>.
            </p>

            <p class="paragraph">
                I'm interested in algorithms, soccer, finance (somewhat), sociology, writing, hardware, and low-level
                programming.
                I also love working towards the mastery of my skills, and I am never content with stagnation.
                I'm on a different mission.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                Below are some of the projects I've worked on.
                I do these type of things to A) hone my skills, B) impress my mates, and C) have fun.
                All of these were done in my free-time,
                barring the modified Shannon Switching Game, which was a final project for CS 4501. I included it
                anyway, because I still think it's pretty
                neat, and it shows how I approach complex, open-ended problems.
